# Task App

[x] Run npx create-react-app task-app.

[x] Create a `components` folder in your `src` directory and create a file for your component called `Overview.js`. `Overview.js` should just render our tasks, while `App.js` is going to handle the input field with the logic.

[x] Optional Easy: Instead of displaying unordered list items, manage the amount of tasks in state and let each task display its number.

[ ] Optional Easy: Implement a delete button for each task. The delete button should remove the specific task from the state array.

[ ] Optional Hard: Implement an edit button for each task. When you press the edit button, this specific task should become changeable, and the edit button should change to a resubmit button.
