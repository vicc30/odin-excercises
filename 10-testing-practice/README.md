# TESTING PRACTICE

This is my solution for the excercises of [Odin project JS Path](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/testing-practice). 

## Excercises

1. Capitalize(string) takes a string and returns that string with the first character capitalized.
2. ReverseString(string) takes a string and returns it reversed.
3. A calculator object that contains the basic operations: add, subtract, divide, and multiply.
4. Caesar Cipher.
5. Array Analysis. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the following properties: average, min, max, and length.
  
    ```javascript 
    const object = analyze([1,8,3,4,2,6]);
    object == {
    average: 4,
    min: 1,
    max: 8,
    length: 6
    };
    ```
## Commands
